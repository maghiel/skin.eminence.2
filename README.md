This fork was created to provide compatibility for Eminence with Kodi 21 Omega. I Love Eminence.
I started off with the work found at https://forum.kodi.tv/archive/index.php?thread-375914-2.html and improved on it a little. Credits to the people there.
All changes in this fork will be sent as pull request upstream.
